        <p>PainOA will  collect some of its data on your health behaviors through short survey questions, such as:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:20px;">
            <li>Over the past week, did experience joint pain? </li>
            <li>When did you experiene the pain?</li>
            <li>Where did you experience hte pain?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Occasionally, there will also be longer surveys that evaluate aspects such as your quality of life, or your sleep duration and quality.</p>
        <p>In general,  more data entered  into the app results in  more accurate and informative  personalized insights .</p>
